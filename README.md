Cartridge holders for Nordson EFD cartridges while you fill and plug them. Works for 1500 mL (750 x 750 ml) side x side (part #7703811) when you print 2x of the 750 ml holders, and 600 mL (300 x 300 ml) side x side (part #7702971 when you print 2x of the 300 ml holders. Small trimming required if using for these combined cartridges. 

These also work for the Nordson EFD Ratio-Pak cartridges, which are single cartridges that get snapped together to make a 2-part cartridge. They are designed for the 75 ml (part #7661540), 150 ml (part #7364433), 300 ml (part #7660650), and 750 ml (part #7661410). 

These were designed to facilitate filling 2-part silicones manually, and used for injection molding soft robotic parts. Manuscript in review: Bell et.al. "Injection Molding Soft Actuators", 2021. https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/publications
